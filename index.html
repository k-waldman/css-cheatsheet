        <h2>What are Selectors and how do they contribute to Specificity?</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors" target="_blank">Selectors</a></h3>
                <p>In CSS, selectors are the terms used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style. This applies to most HTML elements including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Headings</li>
                    <li>Articles</li>
                    <li>Lists</li>
                    <li>And many more!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Selectors can also be used in combination to style even more specific elements, or if you want to avoid styling all elements of a particular type.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity" target="_blank">Specificity</a></h3></h3>
                <p>Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors. If there are multiple selectors that target a specific element, the most specific one will always take preference.</p>
