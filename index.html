        <h1>CSS Selector & Specificity Cheatsheet</h1>
            <p>Selecting proper tags within CSS to target specific HTML elements in your webpage is paramount to both readability of code AND artistic flexibility. This cheatsheet's purpose is to cover the basic tags in regard to their semantic worth and their practical usage or lack thereof.</p>

        <h2>What are Selectors and how do they contribute to Specificity?</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors" target="_blank">Selectors</a></h3>
                <p>In CSS, selectors are the terms used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style. This applies to most HTML elements including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Headings</li>
                    <li>Articles</li>
                    <li>Lists</li>
                    <li>And many more!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Selectors can also be used in combination to style even more specific elements, or if you want to avoid styling all elements of a particular type.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity" target="_blank">Specificity</a></h3></h3>
                <p>Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors. If there are multiple selectors that target a specific element, the most specific one will always take preference. The table below describes common types of selectors from least to most specific.</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Selector</th>
                    <th class="symbol">Symbol(s)</th>
                    <th>Usage</th>
                </tr>    
            </thead>
            
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors" target="_blank">Universal Selector</a></td>
                    <td class="symbol">* {}</td>
                    <td>Matches elements of any type. Useful if you want elements of your webpage to have overarching styles at low specificity to be overwritten by more specific selectors.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors" target="_blank">Type Selectors</a></td>
                    <td>h1, p, section, etc.</td>
                    <td>Selects all elements of a given type throught the document. This will be commonly used to style larger chunks of the same type at face value.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors" target="_blank">Class Selectors</a></td>
                    <td class="symbol">.example {}</td>
                    <td>Selects elements based on their Class attribute. This is denoted by a 'class=""' in the opening tag of the HTML element. As class elements can be used more than once, it is useful for styling elements that you wish to have the same semantic purpose.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors" target="_blank">ID Selectors</a></td>
                    <td class="symbol">#example {}</td>
                    <td>Selects elements based on their id attribute. This is denoted by a 'id=""' in the opening tag of the HTML element. This selectors practical difference from the class selector is that a specific id selector can only be used once. These selectors are the most specific of those that are commonly used, and thus will be often used to style individual elements on your webpage.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>!important</td>
                    <td class="symbol">!important</td>
                    <td>Although not specifically a selector, this rule performs a comparable function in that it overrides any other style declarations present on a given element. This should almost never be used as it is makes debugging significantly more difficult.</td>
                </tr>
